You've gotta install the open food facts python library. 

Run this:
```sudo pip install git+https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-python```
If that doesn't work, you may need to run pip3 instead:
```sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-python```
or, if the above commands don't work, you can try this:
```git clone https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-python
cd openfoodfacts-python
sudo python setup.py install```
